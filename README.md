### Advent of Code 2022

This is my take on the [Advent of Code, 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022),
this time in Rust, which I've been learning for a few months. I managed to keep
the pace until day 10, then I fell behind (I travelled a lot on the 2nd half of
December and the problems got more complex)

I kept working on top of the same files, since the input parsing and test code
were very similar for every day. So, each day is one or two commits. I might
separate each one into a separate directory after I'm done.
